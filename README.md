> *The MCP implementation of GitHub's Spec Kit methodology â€” transforming specifications into executable artifacts*

**An official Model Context Protocol server implementing GitHub's Spec-Driven Development (SDD) methodology**

DinCoder brings the power of [GitHub Spec Kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit) to any AI coding agent through the Model Context Protocol. It transforms the traditional "prompt-then-code-dump" workflow into a systematic, specification-driven process where **specifications don't serve codeâ€”code serves specifications**.

## ðŸŒŸ The Power Inversion: A New Development Paradigm

For decades, code has been king. Specifications were scaffoldingâ€”built, used, then discarded once "real work" began. PRDs guided development, design docs informed implementation, but these were always subordinate to code. Code was truth. Everything else was, at best, good intentions.

**Spec-Driven Development inverts this power structure:**

- **Specifications Generate Code**: The PRD isn't a guideâ€”it's the source that produces implementation
- **Executable Specifications**: Precise, complete specs that eliminate the gap between intent and implementation  
- **Code as Expression**: Code becomes the specification's expression in a particular language/framework
- **Living Documentation**: Maintain software by evolving specifications, not manually updating code

This transformation is possible because AI can understand complex specifications and implement them systematically. But raw AI generation without structure produces chaos. DinCoder provides that structure through GitHub's proven Spec Kit methodology.

## ðŸŽ¯ What is DinCoder?

DinCoder is an MCP server that implements GitHub's Spec-Driven Development methodology, providing:

- **Driven Intent Negotiation**: Collaborative specification refinement through structured dialogue
