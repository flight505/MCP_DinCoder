---

Below is a very, very, very detailed project plan rendered as a markdown checklist. It is organized into "stories," each broken down into one‑story‑point tasks (every checkbox is small and independently completable by an autonomous coding agent). Where a task's rationale depends on external knowledge, I've cited the official MCP spec, Smithery docs, and GitHub Spec Kit materials; where a task is grounded in the uploaded YouTube transcript, I've cited the transcript.

Key external facts used here (with sources):
• Spec Kit provides /specify, /plan, /tasks commands and a standard gated flow (Specify → Plan → Tasks → Implement).  ￼  ￼
• MCP "Streamable HTTP" (Protocol Revision 2025-03-26) requires a single MCP endpoint supporting POST for JSON‑RPC and optional SSE streams, and GET for server‑to‑client SSE; includes session management via the Mcp-Session-Id header and protocol version header (MCP-Protocol-Version).  ￼
• Smithery is **deprecating STDIO support on September 7, 2025** - requires complete HTTP rewrite. Smithery uses WebSocket-based hosting and requires a /mcp endpoint that handles GET/POST/DELETE and optionally receives configuration via ?config=<base64>. Migration offers 20x higher concurrency, lower latency, and better resource efficiency.  ￼
• Official TypeScript SDK (@modelcontextprotocol/sdk v1.17.5+) supports Streamable HTTP since v1.10.0 (April 2025), with built-in StreamableHTTPServerTransport class.  ￼
• Spec Kit works across GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, and Gemini CLI. Multiple MCP implementations exist for spec-driven development including spec-workflow-mcp.  ￼ ￼
• **CRITICAL UPDATE**: For stateless deployments, create new server/transport instances per request to avoid request ID collisions. For stateful deployments, use session management with UUID-based session IDs.

✅ Project: Spec‑Driven MCP Orchestrator (Streamable HTTP, NPM + Smithery)

Story 0 — Load research & extract requirements (video transcript → working notes)

Goal: Read the uploaded YouTube subtitles to ground our understanding of Spec Kit and spec‑driven development; distill actionables.

	•	Open the uploaded transcript file and load it into the repo under docs/research/spec-kit-youtube-transcript.txt.  ￼
	•	Create docs/research/spec-kit-notes.md and summarize: Spec‑driven vs “vibe coding”, and why specs serve as the single source of truth.  ￼
	•	Extract the four gated phases (Specify, Plan, Tasks, Implement) with one‑sentence definitions each.  ￼
	•	Note the CLI ergonomics (initialization creates scripts/templates; branch creation; spec markdown output; “needs clarification” block).
	•	Record that Spec Kit creates a detailed task list with numbered items, favoring test‑first flow in the template.
	•	Export a concise glossary: “spec,” “plan,” “tasks,” “implement,” “acceptance scenarios,” “edge cases,” “research doc,” “zod schema.”  ￼
	•	Commit docs/research/spec-kit-notes.md with transcript references.

⸻

Story 1 — Consolidate current state of the art (Spec Kit + MCP + Smithery)

Goal: Pin authoritative sources and pin versions.

	•	Add docs/refs.md listing authoritative references with short annotations (MCP transports; Smithery deployments; Spec Kit repo/blog; MCP TS/Py SDKs).  ￼ ￼ ￼
	•	In docs/refs.md, capture Streamable HTTP essentials (single endpoint; POST + optional SSE; GET SSE; session header; protocol version header).  ￼
	•	Record Smithery requirements (endpoint = /mcp; handle GET/POST/DELETE; optional ?config=<base64>).  ￼
	•	Confirm Spec Kit cross‑agent support (Copilot, Claude Code, Gemini CLI) and CLI bootstrap command.  ￼ ￼
	•	Pin SDK choices: @modelcontextprotocol/sdk (TS) as primary; document Python SDK parity for future ports.  ￼
	•	Commit docs/refs.md.

⸻

Story 2 — Greenfield repo bootstrap & developer workflow ✅

Goal: Create a clean, boring, reproducible TypeScript workspace.

	• ✅	Initialize repo: git init; create main branch; set default Node to >=20.
	• ✅	Create package.json with type: "module" and scripts: dev, build, lint, format, test, start:local.
	• ✅	Add tsconfig.json (module/moduleResolution: "NodeNext", target: ES2022, strict: true, outDir: dist, rootDir: src). **CRITICAL: Must use NodeNext for MCP SDK compatibility.**
	• ✅	Install runtime deps: @modelcontextprotocol/sdk (^1.17.5+), zod, express.  ￼
	• ✅	Install dev deps: typescript, tsx, vitest, @vitest/coverage-v8, supertest, @types/node, @types/express, eslint, @eslint/js, typescript-eslint, prettier, tsup.
	• ✅	Add .editorconfig (2 spaces, LF, utf‑8).
	• ✅	Add .nvmrc with Node LTS; document with README blurb.
	• ✅	Configure ESLint: eslint.config.mjs with TS parser, node/globals, import rules.
	• ✅	Configure Prettier: prettier.config.cjs.
	•	Add Husky + lint-staged pre‑commit (format + eslint on staged).
	• ✅	Add LICENSE (MIT) and basic README.md skeleton.
	• ✅	Commit as "chore: bootstrap repo".

⸻

Story 3 — Real Spec Kit Integration ✅

Goal: Transform from mock implementation to authentic Spec-Driven Development orchestrator.

	• ✅	Created speckit/detector.ts module for detecting Spec Kit document types from content
	• ✅	Created speckit/parser.ts module for parsing Spec Kit markdown to structured JSON
	• ✅	Created speckit/templates.ts module with official Spec Kit markdown templates
	• ✅	Updated all tools (specify, plan, tasks) to generate real Spec Kit markdown documents
	• ✅	Cached official Spec Kit templates locally in templates/speckit/ directory
	• ✅	Maintained backward compatibility with JSON format while adding markdown support
	• ✅	Tools now generate authentic documents that work with GitHub's SDD methodology
	• ✅	Provides clear path: intent → specification → plan → tasks → implementation

⸻

Story 4 — Plan the technical architecture (align to Streamable HTTP & Smithery)

Goal: Produce a concrete plan honoring spec and platform constraints.

	•	Run /plan with constraints: TypeScript, Express, Streamable HTTP, /mcp endpoint, config via ?config=<base64>.  ￼ ￼
	•	Ensure the plan includes: Data model (Zod schemas), research document, and contracts for object types.  ￼
	•	Verify plan calls out session management and MCP‑Protocol‑Version header handling.  ￼
	•	Verify security guidance: Origin validation, local bind guidance, auth.  ￼
	•	Gate: Approve plan; commit specs/000-orchestrator/plan.md.

⸻

Story 5 — Expand tasks with Spec Kit, then normalize to 1‑point units

Goal: Generate and curate the granular to‑do list used for implementation.

	•	Run /tasks to generate the actionable backlog.  ￼
	•	Split any large items into smaller 1‑point tasks; keep each unit shippable in isolation.  ￼
	•	Ensure early tasks cover environment setup and test‑first where appropriate.  ￼
	•	Commit specs/000-orchestrator/tasks.md as the canonical execution list.

⸻

Story 6 — Implement MCP server skeleton (Streamable HTTP) ✅

Goal: Build a minimal but spec‑compliant server exposing a /mcp endpoint with POST/GET/DELETE.

	• ✅	Create src/server/createServer.ts exporting a factory createServer() that wires tools/resources/prompts using the TS SDK.  ￼
	• ✅	Create src/http/app.ts with an Express app.
	• ✅	Add src/http/transport.ts that wraps StreamableHTTPServerTransport from the TS SDK.  ￼
	• ✅	**CRITICAL**: For stateless mode, create new server/transport instances per request. For stateful mode, implement session map with UUID-based session IDs.
	• ✅	Implement POST /mcp to accept one JSON‑RPC message per request and either SSE (for streamed responses) or JSON per MCP spec.  ￼
	• ✅	Implement GET /mcp to open an SSE stream for server‑initiated messages; return 405 if not supported.  ￼
	• ✅	Implement DELETE /mcp to end a session when Mcp-Session-Id header is provided (if server allows client‑initiated termination).  ￼
	• ✅	Add Mcp-Session-Id issuance on initialization (use crypto.randomUUID()) and enforce header presence on subsequent calls (400 if absent).  ￼
	• ✅	Return/accept MCP-Protocol-Version header; default to "2025-03-26" when absent (per spec guidance).  ￼
	• ✅	Implement Origin checking and optional auth (bearer/API key) middleware.  ￼
	• ✅	Add graceful shutdown (SIGINT/SIGTERM) to close transports. Use res.on('close') to cleanup per-request resources.
	• ✅	Write unit tests for POST/GET/DELETE happy paths and error paths using vitest + supertest.
	• ✅	Add SSE tests ensuring event framing (data: ...\n\n) correctness and stream close after response.  ￼
	• ✅	**Error Handling**: Wrap all handlers in try-catch, log to stderr, return valid JSON-RPC error responses.
	• ✅	Commit "feat(server): minimal MCP streamable HTTP endpoint".

⸻

Story 7 — Implement Spec‑Driven tools inside the MCP server ✅

Goal: Expose tools that run Spec Kit phases and parse artifacts so any AI coder can drive SDD through MCP.

	• ✅	Tool specify.start: inputs { projectName, agent }; runs specify init <projectName> --ai <agent>; returns path + summary.  ￼
	• ✅	Tool specify.describe: inputs { description }; posts /specify <description> into agent session or CLI wrapper; returns generated spec path.  ￼
	• ✅	Tool plan.create: inputs { constraintsText }; posts /plan ... to generate plan.md, data model, contracts; returns file paths.  ￼
	• ✅	Tool tasks.generate: inputs { scope }; posts /tasks to produce tasks.md; returns structured task objects (id, title, deps).  ￼
	• ✅	Tool tasks.tick: mark a task ID as done; persist in tasks.md (idempotent update).  ￼
	• ✅	Tool artifacts.read: return normalized JSON for spec/plan/tasks for downstream UIs.
	• ✅	Tool research.append: write to the Spec Kit research doc for decisions taken.  ￼
	• ✅	Tool git.create_branch: create a working branch for a feature (Spec Kit may do this on init; mirror behavior).  ￼
	• ✅	Add robust path sandboxing (only operate under a configured workspace directory).
	• ✅	Add timeouts and resource limits when running CLI commands.

⸻

	• ✅	Verify MCP‑Protocol‑Version negotiation is honored.  ￼
	• ✅	Create docs/conformance.md summarizing checks with links to spec sections.  ￼

⸻

Story 10 — Configuration, security & ops ✅

Goal: Make it safe to run remotely.

	• ✅	Parse Smithery ?config=<base64> and map to internal config schema (Zod).  ￼
	• ✅	Add CONFIG_ORIGIN_WHITELIST and validate on every request.  ￼
	• ✅	Support API key auth via Authorization: Bearer <token> (optional).
	• ✅	Integrate structured logging (pino); never leak secrets in logs.
	• ✅	Health endpoint GET /healthz (non‑MCP) with build info.
	• ✅	Rate limiting on /mcp (token bucket per IP/session).
	• ✅	Add CORS controls (default deny; allow configured origins).
	• ✅	Provide Dockerfile (node:22-alpine) with non‑root user.
	• ✅	Add SECURITY.md listing threat model and mitigations (DNS rebinding, auth).  ￼

⸻

Story 11 — Developer ergonomics & examples ✅

Goal: Smooth adoption.

	• ✅	examples/local-client.ts: connect using SDK client to local /mcp (POST + SSE).  ￼
	• ✅	examples/smithery-client.ts: connect to https://server.smithery.ai/<pkg>/mcp via StreamableHTTPClientTransport (include config).  ￼
	• ✅	examples/spec-workflow.md: step‑by‑step "run Spec Kit through MCP tools" demo.  ￼
	• ✅	Update README with quick start (local and Smithery) and FAQ.

⸻

Story 12 — Tests: unit, integration, smoke, and performance ✅ MOSTLY COMPLETE

Goal: High confidence, automated.

	• ✅	Integration tests: start Express on ephemeral port; call POST/GET/DELETE; validate SSE. [31/33 tests passing]
	• ✅	JSON-RPC 2.0 compliance tests [All passing]
	• ✅	Error handling tests [All passing]
	• ✅	Protocol version negotiation tests [All passing]
	• ⚠️	Stateful session management tests [2 failing - SDK limitation]
	• ⚠️	Unit tests for every tool handler (valid/invalid inputs). [Partial - need more coverage]
	•	"Spec Kit path" tests: simulate specify/plan/tasks flow and verify artifacts are parsed.
	•	Smoke tests in CI: build → run → hit /healthz → basic POST roundtrip.
	•	Perf baseline: run autocannon at 50 rps on POST; ensure p95 < 150ms for trivial tool.
	•	Coverage gate: fail CI < 90% statements.

⸻

Story 13 — CI/CD & release automation ✅

	• ✅	Add "files" whitelist (exclude test/source by default).
	• ✅	Add README sections: install, usage, config, Smithery notes.  ￼
	• ✅	Run npm pack and inspect tarball.
	• ✅	Publish dry‑run (if configured) → npm publish.

⸻

Story 15 — Smithery integration & deployment ✅

Goal: Make it live on Smithery and compatible with the platform.

	• ✅	Create smithery.yaml (not json) with runtime: "typescript" configuration per Smithery TypeScript deployment guide.  ￼
	• ✅	Configure package.json with build/dev scripts using @smithery/cli.
	• ✅	Structure server with default export function createServer({ config }) returning McpServer instance.
	• ✅	Add optional configSchema export using Zod for configuration validation.
	• ✅	Ensure /mcp implements GET/POST/DELETE exactly per Smithery expectations.  ￼
	• ✅	Ensure support for ?config=<base64> query param decoded and validated.  ￼
	• ✅	**CRITICAL**: Ensure HTTP transport only - STDIO deprecated September 7, 2025.
	• ✅	Consider using ts-smithery-cli approach for simplest migration path.
	• ✅	Add "Deploy on Smithery" instructions to README (GitHub integration method).  ￼
	•	Post‑deploy smoke test using Smithery's recommended client flow (Streamable HTTP client).  ￼
	•	Document API key usage where applicable (Smithery registry/SDK).  ￼

⸻

Story 16 — Migration path (if upgrading an existing STDIO server) ✅

Goal: Provide a crisp path to Streamable HTTP (and optionally maintain compatibility).

	• ✅	Capture current STDIO entrypoint and tool registrations; freeze a "before" tag.
	• ✅	Create HTTP transport entry (/mcp) alongside STDIO temporarily; verify both work.  ￼
	• ✅	Replace server bootstrap to not write to stdout (HTTP is fine; STDIO must not log on stdout).
	• ✅	Remove legacy SSE transport if present and document backwards compatibility choices.  ￼
	• ✅	Update docs for new connection instructions and note deprecation of STDIO hosting where applicable (per vendor communications).
	• ⏳	Remove STDIO once clients have migrated; cut major version; update Smithery deployment type. [Scheduled for Sept 2025]

⸻

Story 17 — Cross‑agent validation (Copilot, Claude Code, Cursor, Gemini)

Goal: Prove it works across the common agent surfaces Spec Kit targets.

	•	Write a lab note for Copilot: how to connect, run Spec‑Driven tools, and view streamed output.  ￼
	•	Write a lab note for Claude Code with the same flow.  ￼
	•	Write a lab note for Gemini CLI with the same flow.  ￼
	•	Validate that task numbering and spec artifacts look consistent to all agents (the Spec Kit convention).  ￼
	•	Capture agent‑specific quirks and workarounds in docs/agents.md.

⸻

Story 18 — Observability & diagnostics

Goal: Make it debuggable.

	•	Add request/response logging with correlation ID per session (avoid content logging; log envelopes).
	•	Add “debug mode” flag to include timing and stream event counts.
	•	Add /metrics (Prometheus text format) for basic counters (requests, SSE connections, errors).
	•	Provide LOG_LEVEL env var; default info.

⸻

Story 19 — Hardening & security checks

Goal: Lower risk and prove care.

	•	Dependency scanning: npm audit and (optional) Snyk in CI.
	•	Fuzz minimal JSON‑RPC payloads to ensure 400/422 paths are correct.
	•	Ensure Origin checks enforced and unit tested.  ￼
	•	Red‑team review doc listing auth model and secrets handling.
	•	Add e2e test for Mcp-Session-Id rotation (server invalidates old session → client gets 404 → re‑init).  ￼

⸻

Story 20 — Documentation polish

Goal: Great first‑time experience.

	•	Expand README with architecture diagram (request flow, SSE stream).
	•	Add a “Spec‑Driven Quickstart” section mapping the four phases to the exposed tools.  ￼
	•	Add troubleshooting: common HTTP/SSE pitfalls, protocol version header, Origin errors.  ￼
	•	Add examples section with copy‑paste commands for local & Smithery usage.  ￼

⸻

Story 21 — Release v0.1.0 and beyond

Goal: Ship and iterate safely.

	•	Set version to 0.1.0; create tag and GitHub release.
	•	npm publish; capture URL in README badges.
	•	Register/publish on Smithery and verify the listing + deployment works end‑to‑end.  ￼
	•	Open roadmap issues for future: Python port; advanced resumability; richer auth; multi‑tenant configs.  ￼

⸻

Story 22 — Best Practices & Common Pitfalls Prevention

Goal: Implement research-backed patterns to avoid known issues.

	•	**Session Management**: Implement proper session ID validation (visible ASCII 0x21-0x7E only).
	•	**Error Handling**: Use McpError class with ErrorCode enum for protocol-level errors.
	•	**Stateless vs Stateful**: Document when to use each mode (stateless for serverless, stateful for persistent connections).
	•	**Request ID Collisions**: Ensure new transport instances per request in stateless mode to prevent collisions.
	•	**Browser Compatibility**: Test session management in both Node.js and browser environments.
	•	**Timeout Management**: Handle long-running operations with progress updates to reset 60-second timeout.
	•	**Logging**: All diagnostic output to stderr only, never to stdout (critical for STDIO compatibility).
	•	**TypeScript Config**: Verify module: "NodeNext" and moduleResolution: "NodeNext" in tsconfig.json.
	•	**Version Negotiation**: Handle MCP-Protocol-Version header properly with fallback to "2025-03-26".
	•	**Resource Cleanup**: Use res.on('close') for proper cleanup of per-request resources.
	•	Document all patterns in docs/best-practices.md with code examples.

⸻

Story 23 — Optional: Backwards compatibility with HTTP+SSE 2024‑11‑05 (legacy)

Goal: Serve older clients during a transition (if needed).

	•	Decide whether to also expose the old SSE endpoint(s) alongside the new MCP endpoint.  ￼
	•	If yes, implement the legacy GET SSE initiation and POST pairing as described in the spec’s backward‑compatibility section.  ￼
	•	Add tests proving both transports operate without message duplication.  ￼
	•	Document sunset schedule; remove legacy in a future major.

## Lessons Learned from v0.1.7 Release

### Critical Features Delivered

1. **Real Spec Kit Integration** ✅ TRANSFORMATIVE
   - **Achievement**: Transformed from mock implementation to authentic Spec-Driven Development
   - **Implementation**: Created 3 new modules (detector.ts, parser.ts, templates.ts)
   - **Impact**: Now generates real Spec Kit markdown documents that work with GitHub's SDD methodology
   - **Compatibility**: Maintains backward compatibility with JSON format while adding markdown support

2. **CI/CD Pipeline Fixed** ✅
   - **Issue**: Smoke test failure in CI environment
   - **Fix**: Set PORT=3000 environment variable in CI configuration
   - **Result**: All 33 tests now passing (100% pass rate)

3. **Smithery Deployment Ready** ✅
   - **Configuration**: smithery.yaml with runtime: "typescript"
   - **Structure**: Default export function for Smithery compatibility
   - **Features**: Base64 config parameter support implemented
   - **Documentation**: Added "Deploy on Smithery" button to README

### Critical Issues Resolved (from v0.1.6)

1. **Tool Naming Validation** ⚠️ CRITICAL
   - **Issue**: MCP tools with periods in names (e.g., "specify.start") violated the validation pattern `^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]{1,64}$`
   - **Impact**: Complete Claude Desktop integration failure
   - **Fix**: Changed all 15 tool names from periods to underscores (e.g., "specify_start")
   - **Lesson**: Always validate tool names against MCP specification early

2. **External Command Dependencies**
   - **Issue**: specify_start tool attempted to execute external `uvx specify init` command
   - **Impact**: Tool failure in environments without Spec Kit CLI installed
   - **Fix**: Replaced with self-contained file system operations creating .dincoder directory
   - **Lesson**: MCP tools should be self-contained and not rely on external CLI tools

3. **Directory Structure Standardization**
   - **Issue**: Scattered spec files across specs/ directory made navigation difficult
   - **Impact**: Poor developer experience and confusing file organization
   - **Fix**: Consolidated all artifacts under .dincoder/ directory with clear subdirectories
   - **Lesson**: Use a single, well-organized directory for all generated artifacts

4. **STDIO Deprecation Planning**
   - **Issue**: STDIO transport will be discontinued on Smithery by September 7, 2025
   - **Impact**: All servers must migrate to HTTP transport
   - **Fix**: Created comprehensive migration guide (docs/stdio-migration-guide.md)
   - **Benefits**: 20x higher concurrency, lower latency, better resource efficiency
   - **Lesson**: Plan transport migrations well in advance with clear documentation

### Technical Improvements

1. **Natural Language Input Parsing**
   - Added intelligent parsing for specify_describe to accept natural language inputs
   - Strips common prefixes like "/specify", "I want to", etc.
   - Makes tools more user-friendly and forgiving

2. **Error Handling Enhancement**
   - Added actionable next steps in error messages
   - Improved error context with file paths and suggestions
   - Better user guidance when operations fail

3. **Quality Tool Integration**
   - Successfully integrated 6 quality tools (format, lint, test, security_audit, deps_update, license_check)
   - Fixed undefined stderr reference bug in quality.ts
   - All tools now properly handle project path resolution

### Documentation Achievements

1. **Comprehensive Testing Guide**
   - Created TESTING_GUIDE.md covering all 21 tools (15 core + 6 quality)
   - Detailed test procedures for each tool
   - Expected outputs and validation steps

2. **CI/CD Infrastructure**
   - GitHub Actions workflows for CI (ci.yml) and release (release.yml)
   - Automated testing on Node 20.x and 22.x
   - NPM publication workflow with provenance

3. **Migration Documentation**
   - STDIO to HTTP migration guide with timeline
   - Step-by-step migration instructions
   - Common issues and solutions
   - Performance improvement metrics

## 🎯 PHASE 1: CORE COMPLETENESS (v0.2.0)

**Goal:** Achieve feature parity with essential Spec Kit workflow for AI coding assistants
**Timeline:** 2 weeks (~1 sprint)
**New Tools:** 7 (constitution_create, clarify_add, clarify_resolve, spec_validate, artifacts_analyze, spec_refine, prereqs_check)
**Total Tools After Phase 1:** 21

Story 24 — Constitution/Principles Tool ⭐ CRITICAL

Goal: Enable projects to define principles and constraints that guide all AI-generated artifacts.

Rationale: Without a constitution, specs can drift from project values. Constitution provides guardrails for AI when generating specs, plans, and tasks. Similar to GitHub Spec Kit's `/constitution` command but adapted for MCP context.

Tools to Implement:
	•	constitution_create - Define project principles, constraints, and preferences

Tasks:
	•	Create src/tools/constitution.ts module
	•	Define ConstitutionCreateSchema with Zod:
		○	projectName: string (name of project)
		○	principles: string[] (e.g., "Prefer functional patterns", "Avoid premature optimization")
		○	constraints: string[] (e.g., "Max bundle size: 500KB", "Support Node 20+")
		○	preferences: object with optional fields:
			§	libraries?: string[] (e.g., ["React Query over Redux"])
			§	patterns?: string[] (e.g., ["Repository pattern for data access"])
			§	style?: string (e.g., "Functional > OOP")
		○	workspacePath?: string (optional workspace directory)

Tools to Implement:
	•	clarify_add - Flag ambiguities in specifications
	•	clarify_resolve - Resolve clarifications with structured answers

Tasks:
	•	Create src/tools/clarify.ts module

		○	question: string (the clarification question)
		○	context: string (section of spec that's ambiguous)
		○	options?: string[] (possible resolutions)
		○	specPath?: string (path to spec.md, auto-detected if not provided)
		○	workspacePath?: string
	•	Define ClarifyResolveSchema with Zod:
		○	clarificationId: string (unique ID like CLARIFY-001)
		○	resolution: string (the answer/decision)
		○	rationale?: string (why this resolution was chosen)
		○	workspacePath?: string
	•	Implement clarification storage:
		○	Create .dincoder/clarifications.json for tracking
		○	Schema: { id, question, context, options, status, resolution?, resolvedAt?, addedAt }
		○	Use JSON for structured querying
	•	Implement clarifyAdd():
		○	Generate unique clarification ID (CLARIFY-001, CLARIFY-002, etc.)
		○	Parse spec.md to find existing [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers
		○	Store clarification in clarifications.json with status: "pending"
		○	Optionally update spec.md with ID marker: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: CLARIFY-001]
		○	Return clarification ID and summary
	•	Implement clarifyResolve():
		○	Load clarifications.json
		○	Find clarification by ID
		○	Mark as status: "resolved" with resolution and timestamp
		○	Update spec.md: replace [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ID] with resolution text
		○	Append resolution to research.md under "Clarifications" section
		○	Git commit with message: "Resolve CLARIFY-001: [question]"
		○	Return success with resolution summary
	•	Add list functionality (optional helper):
		○	clarifyList() to show all pending clarifications
	•	Add tool registration in src/server/createServer.ts
	•	Write unit tests in tests/tools/clarify.test.ts:

	•	Implement artifactsAnalyze():
		○	Load spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md
		○	Check spec vs plan consistency:
			§	All spec goals covered in plan
			§	No plan components not in spec
		○	Check plan vs tasks consistency:
			§	All plan components have tasks
			§	No orphaned tasks (not in plan)
		○	Detect missing tasks for planned features
		○	Return consistency report with issues
	•	Add tool registration in src/server/createServer.ts

		○	reason: string (why this refinement is needed)
		○	specPath?: string (auto-detect if not provided)
		○	workspacePath?: string
	•	Implement markdown section parser in src/speckit/parser.ts:
