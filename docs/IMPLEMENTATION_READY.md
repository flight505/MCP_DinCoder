## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate (Ready to Start)
1. ✅ **Story 24 Completion**
   - Add integration test (constitution → specify → plan workflow)
   - Update README with constitution_create examples
   - Update workflow guide (Step 0: Define Constitution)

2. 📋 **Story 25 Implementation (clarify_add/resolve)**
   - Create src/tools/clarify.ts
   - Implement clarifications.json storage
   - Add spec.md marker insertion/replacement
   - Write tests

3. 📋 **Story 26 Implementation (spec_validate/artifacts_analyze)**
   - Create src/tools/validate.ts
   - Create src/speckit/validators.ts
   - Implement validation rules
   - Write tests

### Blocked (Waiting)
- ⏸️ **Feature Voting Publication**
  - Blocked until more tools are coded and tested

## 🔍 For Review

Please review the following documents and provide feedback:

### 1. **Feature Analysis** ([FEATURE_ANALYSIS.md](FEATURE_ANALYSIS.md))
**Questions:**
- Does the MCP-fit analysis make sense?
- Are the critical gaps correctly identified?
- Any features we missed or shouldn't include?

### 2. **Roadmap** ([ROADMAP_UPDATED.md](ROADMAP_UPDATED.md))
**Questions:**
- Is the 4-phase approach reasonable?
- Should any features be moved between phases?
- Is the ~10-week timeline to v1.0 realistic?

### 3. **Phase 1 Plan** ([plan.md](../plan.md) Stories 24-28)
**Questions:**
- Are the 5 critical features the right starting point?
- Should we add/remove any Story 24-28?
- Is the task breakdown detailed enough?

### 4. **Prototype Tool** ([src/tools/constitution.ts](../src/tools/constitution.ts))
**Questions:**
- Does the constitution tool work as expected?
- Is the template structure good?
- Should we modify the design before implementing others?

## 📝 Pending Decisions

Before coding Phase 1:

1. **Feature Priority Confirmation**
   - Confirm: constitution, clarify, validate, refine, prereqs are top 5
   - Alternative: Swap any with Phase 2 features?

2. **Implementation Order**
   - Proposed: Story 24 → 25 → 26 → 27 → 28
   - Alternative: Different order based on dependencies?

3. **Release Strategy**
   - Option A: Release v0.2.0 after all Phase 1 stories complete
   - Option B: Release v0.1.x for each story (faster feedback)

4. **Testing Approach**
   - Current: Unit tests + integration tests
   - Addition: E2E workflow tests? Manual testing checklist?
